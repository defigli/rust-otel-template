# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release security updates for the latest stable version. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainer directly (see GitHub profile). We will respond as soon as possible to address the issue.

- Please do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been resolved.
- Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and address the issue.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and patched, we will publish an advisory and update the repository accordingly.

## Dependency Security

We use automated tools (e.g., `cargo audit`) to monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies. Users are encouraged to run `cargo audit` regularly and keep dependencies up to date.
